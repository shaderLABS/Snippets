# Git Attributes
> by Luna5ama

.gitattributes file that makes GitHub detects your shaders files correctly as GLSL files instead of some other random file types. 
So they shows up correctly as GLSL in the "repo language", as well as code highlighting.

## Usage
Place the `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository.
